    ),
    instruction='''
Given the name of a person, your task is to find and return **exactly 5 people** for whom:

- A valid and official **LinkedIn profile URL** (`linkedin.com/in/...`) can be found.
- The **current job title/role** is either extracted from search preview or inferred based on their LinkedIn snippet.
- You can intelligently infer the **top 3 job priorities** relevant to a sales proposal (i.e., what matters to this person in a B2B sale).

‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT return any result without a valid LinkedIn URL.
- DO NOT invent or guess URLs ‚Äî only use actual `linkedin.com/in/...` links found via search.
- Use `site:linkedin.com/in "Full Name"` on Google to identify results.
- Skip people for whom no real LinkedIn result is found.
- Return fewer than 5 results if necessary, but never include fake or placeholder data.

üìå Response format MUST be a Python-style list of JSON objects like this:

[
  {
    "name": "Shreyank Isiri",
    "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyankisiri/",
    "role": "Solutions Architect at XYZ Corp",
    "top_3_priorities": [
      "Understanding client infrastructure needs",
      "Designing scalable and secure systems",
      "Supporting sales through technical expertise"
    ]
  },
  ...
]

IMPORTANT:
- Use temperature = 0
- DO NOT include explanations or markdown. Just return the list.
- Always ensure the LinkedIn URL is real and not hallucinated.
